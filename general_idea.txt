
* atomic init -- configuration file (atomic file in project dir). 
	- can have user define a template to use for specific language or custom template?
	- ideal to have it sniff project to detect file type to autodetect.

	- [ ] checks for existance of atomic.toml in project
		- [ ] creates file based on template user specifies
	- [ ] checks for existance of state in appdata/roaming/atomic/
	

* atomic watch -- user provides optional issue number to help track progress and on `atomic build, test, run or custom command` 
	we would do a local atomic commit with issue name + command name + number

	- [ ] get git info
		- [ ] if not present in git branch, prompt user for details needed

	- [ ] if watch is started without a init file, warn user
	- [ ] 

* atomic stop

* atomic custom commands K,V pair so long as they dont collide

* pre-post hooks
    - pre: external script to call prior to doing run
	- post: cleanup - post run script calling depending on run success

* state file + sqlite db for good metrics
	current issue number
	issue name
	branch name
	failure rates in post hooks for build , test, run
	possibly table for std-out / std-err output
