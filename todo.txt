# File Watcher / Auto-Trigger
Run a plugin whenever files change (√† la nodemon, watchexec):
`atomic watch --plugin dev-server --glob "src/**/*"`
Would re-run the plugin on file changes.


üó∫Ô∏è 20. Named Profiles
Support different atomic setups for different environments:

[profiles.dev]
include = ["build", "lint", "dev-server"]

[profiles.deploy]
include = ["test", "build", "deploy"]
Run with:

atomic --profile deploy
