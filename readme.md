## What's Atomic?

Atomic is a command-line tool designed to streamline the process of making "atomic" commits. It addresses the challenge of remembering to save frequent snapshots of your code without disrupting your workflow. By defining custom commands in an atomic.toml file located in your project's root directory, Atomic allows you to execute your desired actions while automatically creating local commit snapshots in Git. This ensures that your changes are captured efficiently and without interrupting your focus.
